**Sprint Start**: Session 4 completion
**Current Status**: P0 Task 1 Complete, New Issue Discovered

## ‚úÖ Task 1: Fix Linux CI Permissions (COMPLETE)

### Problem (Session 4)
```
scripts/dev/orchestrate.sh: line 120: /home/runner/work/.../scripts/dev/step.sh: Permission denied
```

### Root Cause
- Git on Windows doesn't preserve Unix executable bit
- All shell scripts committed as `100644` (regular file)
- Linux CI runner couldn't execute without `+x` permission

### Solution Implemented
```bash
git update-index --chmod=+x scripts/dev/*.sh
# Changed 15 shell scripts from 100644 to 100755
```

### Files Fixed
1. scripts/dev/analyze_flutter.sh
2. scripts/dev/ingest_slice.sh
3. scripts/dev/orchestrate.sh
4. scripts/dev/push_release.sh
5. scripts/dev/run_demo.sh
6. scripts/dev/run_mvp.sh
7. scripts/dev/serve_uvicorn.sh
8. scripts/dev/smoke_chat.sh
9. scripts/dev/smoke_lessons.sh
10. scripts/dev/smoke_tts.sh
11. scripts/dev/ssh_agent.sh
12. scripts/dev/step.sh
13. scripts/dev/test_real_providers.sh
14. scripts/dev/test_web_smoke.sh
15. scripts/dev/with_git_env.sh

### Verification

**CI Run**: https://github.com/antonsoo/AncientLanguages/actions/runs/18177341285

**Before Fix** (Commit e6ce7ff):
```
linux  Orchestrate up  Permission denied: scripts/dev/step.sh
linux  Orchestrate up  cleanup_needed: unbound variable
linux  Orchestrate up  ##[error]Process completed with exit code 1
```

**After Fix** (Commit 2807512):
```
linux  Orchestrate up  bash scripts/dev/orchestrate.sh up --flutter
linux  Orchestrate up  db Pulling
linux  Orchestrate up  [script executes successfully]
linux  Orchestrate up  [NEW ERROR: sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet]
```

### Result
‚úÖ **Permission error ELIMINATED**
‚úÖ **Scripts now execute on Linux CI**
üîç **New error discovered: Alembic greenlet issue**

**Status**: Task 1 COMPLETE - Permission fix successful

---

## üîç New Issue Discovered: Alembic Greenlet Error

### Error Details
```
File "/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.12.11/x64/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sqlalchemy/util/langhelpers.py", line 224, in __exit__
sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet: greenlet_spawn has not been called; can't call await_only() here.
Was IO attempted in an unexpected place?
(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/xd2s)

::STEP::alembic::FAIL::exit_1
##[error]Process completed with exit code 1
```

### Analysis
**What This Means**:
- SQLAlchemy async context error
- Alembic migrations trying to use async operations incorrectly
- Likely Python 3.12 + SQLAlchemy 2.x compatibility issue

**Why This Wasn't Seen Before**:
- Permission error blocked orchestrator before reaching Alembic step
- This is the FIRST TIME CI has progressed past script execution
- Bug existed but was hidden by permission issue

**Impact**:
- Linux CI still fails, but at a LATER stage (progress!)
- Database migrations can't run on CI
- Smoke tests and E2E tests still blocked

### Root Cause Investigation Needed
1. Check SQLAlchemy version in requirements.txt
2. Verify async context usage in Alembic migrations
3. Check if greenlet compatibility issue with Python 3.12
4. Review migration files for async/await patterns

## Task Status Update

### Completed
- ‚úÖ **Task 1**: Fix Linux permissions (P0) - COMPLETE

### In Progress
- üîç **NEW**: Investigate Alembic greenlet error (P0) - BLOCKING

### Pending
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Task 2**: Fix Windows DB startup (P0) - Still failing with exit code 18
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Task 3**: Verify CI green (P0) - Blocked by Alembic issue
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Task 4**: Populate token table (P1) - Can proceed independently
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Task 5**: Ingest full Iliad (P1) - Can proceed independently

---

## Windows CI Status (Unchanged)

**Still Failing**:
```
step 'db_up' failed with exit code 18
```

**Analysis**: Docker/PostgreSQL startup issue, unrelated to permission fix

**Status**: Deferred (Task 2 remains)

## Sprint 4 Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks Started | 1 (Task 1: Linux permissions) |
| Tasks Completed | 1 (100%) |
| New Issues Found | 1 (Alembic greenlet) |
| CI Progress | Permission error ‚Üí Alembic error (deeper into pipeline) |
| Time Spent | ~30 minutes |

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Tonight)
1. Document permission fix success
2. Create GitHub issue for Alembic greenlet error
3. Update SPRINT_4_TASKS.md with completion status

### Tomorrow (Task 2 alternatives)
**Option A**: Fix Alembic greenlet error (unblock Linux CI)
- Research SQLAlchemy async context best practices
- Update migration files if needed
- Test locally with Python 3.12

**Option B**: Proceed with P1 tasks (token table, Iliad ingestion)
- These can run locally independent of CI
- Proves features work even if CI blocked

**Option C**: Investigate Windows DB startup (Task 2 original)
- Still a separate blocker
- May require Docker configuration changes

## Key Achievements

### Session 4 ‚Üí Sprint 4 Transition
- ‚úÖ Integration features working (text-range, register)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation (3 reports, 1700+ lines)
- ‚úÖ Sprint 4 roadmap created
- ‚úÖ First P0 task completed within 30 minutes

### Permission Fix Impact
- **Before**: CI failed at script execution (couldn't even start)
- **After**: CI progresses to database migrations (deeper testing)
- **Result**: Uncovered previously hidden Alembic bug

**This is PROGRESS** - each fix reveals the next layer of issues

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Layered Debugging Works**: Fix permission ‚Üí uncover Alembic ‚Üí next layer visible
2. **Quick Wins First**: Task 1 took 30 minutes, immediate ROI
3. **Document Everything**: Progress report captures new findings
4. **Expect Hidden Issues**: Permission fix revealed Alembic bug (good!)
