# The ancient languages app
An app to most effectively teach the most ancient languages.

The app will be utilizing techniques coming from latest AI research to reconstruct languages, and to organize them in highly effective lessons to teach to others.

Planned languages in the app (in order of them being added/integrated into the app): 
1. Koine Greek (starting with the ancient dialect from around 4th century BC and active until around the 7th century AD; eventually adding Byzantine Koine Greek, and other dialects), 
2. Classical Greek (starting with Homer's Classical Greek; eventually adding older and newer dialects, as well as dialects based on the different Hellenic regions), 
3. Latin (eventually multiple dialects of Latin, from non-common regions and from other centuries), 
7. Old Church Slavonic (starting with the most ancient 9th century AD, reconstructed form of the language), 
8. Ancient Sumerian (starting with the most ancient standardized, 31st century BC, reconstructed form of the language),
4. Hebrew (from around 1st century AD, and later, other dialects from non-common regions and from other centuries), 
5. Ancient Aramaic (including the Galilean dialect, and later, other dialects from non-common regions and from other centuries), 
6. Paleo-Hebrew (reconstruction of the theorized, most ancient form of Hebrew), 
9. Ancient Akkadian (starting with the most ancient standardized, 24th-22nd century BC, reconstructed form of the language),
10. Ancient Vedic & Dravidian languages (the reconstructed common ancestor of the Indo-European language family).
10. Proto-Indo-European (the reconstructed root language of the main language family tree of European and Indian languages).
10. And many other languages.

So far I've done some work on reconstructing the following languages for this app: Aramaic, Paleo-Hebrew, Koine Greek.
Currently, I'm following a new approach, to get Koine Greek, up and running and ready for learning.
