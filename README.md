## The Problem

Every translation loses something. Ancient Greek has four words for "love"—*eros*, *philia*, *agape*, *storge*. English collapses them to one. Poetic meter vanishes. Puns disappear. You're reading an interpreter's choices, not the author's words.

**The solution?** Learn the original language.

## What This Is

The first comprehensive platform for learning **38 ancient languages** using modern AI—from Sumerian cuneiform (3100 BCE) to medieval manuscripts. Built on research-grade linguistic data (Perseus, LSJ, TLA Berlin, ORACC UPenn), not AI hallucinations.

**Not just Greek and Latin.** Humanity's full linguistic heritage—Indo-European, Semitic, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Mesoamerican, and more.

## Languages

### ✅ 38 Languages Implemented

**All languages support AI lesson generation, vocabulary practice, and text-based learning.**

**Core languages** (enhanced support with interactive reader, morphological analysis):
- 🏺 Classical Greek (grc)
- 🏛️ Classical Latin (lat)
- 🪷 Classical Sanskrit (san)
- 🕎 Biblical Hebrew (hbo)

**Fully supported** (lesson generation, vocabulary, daily phrases):
- 🔆 Sumerian (sux)
- 🏹 Akkadian (akk)
- 🪲 Egyptian (egy, egy-old)
- 📖 Koine Greek (grc-koi)
- 🍎 Paleo-Hebrew (hbo-paleo)
- ⚔️ Old Norse (non)
- 🗡️ Gothic (got)
- 📜 Old English (ang)
- 🐉 Classical Chinese (lzh)
- 🌽 Classical Nahuatl (nah)
- ☀️ Classical Quechua (que)
- 🔥 Avestan (ave)
- ☦️ Old Church Slavonic (cu)
- ⛪ Coptic (cop)
- ✝️ Classical Syriac (syc)
- 🕌 Classical Arabic (arb)
- 📿 Ge'ez (gez)
- 🗿 Hittite (hit)
- 🌸 Classical Armenian (xcl)
- 🏔️ Classical Tibetan (bod)
- 🎭 Phoenician (phn)
- 📚 Ugaritic (uga)
- 🏛️ Classical Aramaic (arc)
- 📖 Pali (pli)
- 🇯🇵 Classical Japanese (ojp)
- 🕉️ Vedic Sanskrit (san-ved)
- 🎎 Old Tamil (tam)
- And more...

**Development approach:** Core languages receive priority for advanced features (interactive reader, full morphological analysis, conversational AI). All other languages have functional lesson generation and will receive enhanced features progressively.

## Key Features

### 🎓 AI Lesson Generation

Generate exercises from authentic texts—not "The apple is red," but real passages from Homer, the *Ṛgveda*, and Pyramid Texts.

- **Alphabet drills** — Master Greek letters, Hebrew script, cuneiform, hieroglyphics
- **Vocabulary matching** — Context-based from real literature
- **Cloze exercises** — Fill-in-blank from authentic passages
- **Translation practice** — Ancient ↔ English with AI feedback

Target specific passages: "Generate lesson from *Iliad* 1.20-1.50"

### 📖 Interactive Reader

Tap any word for instant scholarly analysis. Currently available: Homer's *Iliad* with full Perseus morphological data.

```
Tap "Μῆνιν" (first word of the Iliad) →

Lemma: μῆνις
Morphology: Feminine accusative singular
LSJ: "wrath, anger, especially of the gods"
Grammar: Smyth §175 (Accusative of Respect)
Etymology: PIE *mē- ("anger")
```

Works offline—all linguistic data embedded.

### 💬 Conversational Practice

Chat with AI-powered historical personas in their native languages:

- 🏛️ **Athenian philosopher** — Socratic dialogue in Classical Greek
- ⚔️ **Spartan warrior** — Laconic military speech
- 🏺 **Roman senator** — Ciceronian rhetoric in Latin
- 𓂋 **Egyptian scribe** — Hieratic script and scribal formulas
- 𒀭 **Sumerian lugal** — Cuneiform royal inscriptions

### 🏆 Progress Tracking

- XP & levels with algorithmic progression
- Daily streaks
- Achievements & badges
- ELO skill ratings per grammar topic
- Text statistics (vocabulary %, reading speed, comprehension)

## Why This Matters

### For Language Learners

Learn ancient languages the way you'd learn Spanish in a modern language app—but with scholarly accuracy and authentic texts. No dry textbooks. No "The apple is red." Just real Homer, real Plato, real Vedas.

### For Scholars & Educators

Research-grade linguistic data meets modern UX. Instant morphological analysis and semantic search that would take hours with physical dictionaries. Perfect for teaching or research.

### For Developers

Showcase of AI-powered education done right. October 2025 LLM APIs, vector search with pgvector, multi-provider architecture, 173+ tests passing, professional development practices.

### For Humanity

Ancient languages are living connections to our ancestors. When they fade, we lose entire conceptual frameworks, rhetorical traditions, and direct access to primary sources. This platform reverses that loss.

## The Opportunity

### Market

- **$60B+ global language learning market**
- **10M+ potential users** (students, scholars, theology students, homeschoolers, lifelong learners)
- **Zero modern competitors** with AI + comprehensive ancient language coverage

### What We've Built

**Production-ready platform.** Using AI-assisted development, this project demonstrates 1000x traditional velocity—verify [commit history](../../graphs/contributors):

- ✅ 4 core languages with full morphological analysis and interactive reading
- ✅ 30,000+ lines of Python, 90,000+ lines of Dart/Flutter
- ✅ 173+ tests passing with comprehensive validation
- ✅ Professional codebase ready for institutional adoption

### Funding Accelerates This

**Seeking seed funding** to:
- Hire 2-3 engineers for parallel language development
- Contract PhD linguists for text curation
- Build university partnerships
- Launch public alpha

**Accelerated roadmap with funding:**
- **Month 3:** Enhanced support for 12 core languages, first university pilot
- **Month 6:** Full morphological analysis for 20 languages, 3-5 institutional partnerships
- **Month 12:** Complete feature parity for all 38 languages, 10+ university adoptions, sustainable revenue

*Note: All 38 languages already have functional lesson generation. Funding accelerates adding advanced features (interactive reader, full morphological analysis, conversational AI) to more languages.*
