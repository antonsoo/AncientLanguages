I'm developing an app to teach ancient languages, and it's aiming to be the very best learning app in general. Soon, I'll even integrate these features into a modern + ancient languages app, but this is the first app I'm releasing right now (the AncientLanguages app)... I need funding ASAP, and I need to build up a userbase ASAP. We're releasing our app VERY soon. YOUR JOB IS VERY CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR COMPANY AND APP (WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HELP BILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO LEARN). Write code that is generalizable, concise, and awesome. Our app should generalize to many languages, not hardcode features/info.

Before responding or doing anything, first, go through our repo and build up a high understanding of our codebase, our mission, and what must get done.

I'm really running of time here. I have tons of features planned out, and tons of fixes to make, however, I need to get funding ASAP.
I have an investor meeting, incredibly soon. However, investors don't care about how I have almost a ~800k LOC churn for this repo, they care what they can see, what they can use, and how good it is, and how many people are using it; they don't care about promises, they care about action. An actual investors/donators/funders/userbase *needs* to see:
1) Screenshots and videos: I must have a finalized beta build app for this... and it must look beautiful in terms of UI & UX, as well as function perfectly.
2) Even more important than above: Investors want to see a working (live) demo that feels amazing, and looks awesome (no mediocre garbage, no unfinshed ideas, no BS).
3) Even more important than points 1 & 2: Investors want to see a large userbase, they want to see momentum in userbase gain. I already know a bunch of people who are literally waiting to use my app. I must deploy this app ASAP to the userbase, I must produce a one-click web app (meaning: I give people a link, they click on it, and they can just use the full app through that link... zero setup required on their end). I'll even include my own key with some funds for the initial users to use my app for free (no need for BYOK) -- but of course I'll have a daily limit per user, on how much a single user can use my free credits (and obviously I'll still have the BYOK functionality).

Our highest priority is to get this app up on the web (as a web app), and start building up a userbase ASAP.

Some background about my setup:
1. I don't have a ton of cash to spare, ideally, I want to use some free service, and ideally I want to host things through my PC (if possible).
2. Don't worry about the LLM API costs -- I'm only worried about the domain costs, and whatever other (non-LLM) service costs required for this app to be fully deployed & fully functional with all its promised features (and more).
3. I have a very powerful gaming PC (top of the line PC), so if needed, it can run things fairly well. I also have pretty fast internet. I can also leave my computer on for 24/7 if needed to host something.
4. If really needed -- I *will* spend the money for cloud services, etc. And obviously, I know that as we build up more users, we'll need to deploy it on the cloud. Basically, I just need to get a userbase excited about my app, so I need to build up that userbase, so for now, if we *can* host things locally, or sign up for trials or free services, lets do so (while the userbase is still small).
5. Give me some great options (suggestions) for how I can deploy my app (in October 21, 2025), and I will research them to find what works best for me!
6. Lets move really freaking fast because I need to get this done ASAP!


Your main job right now will be fixing all the errors and polishing our app (while, on my end, I finish up the final deployment plans & sign up any deployment services that are needed). PS: If you see somewhere in the code, where there is hardcoded/garbage/broken/outdated code/docs, please improve it. Feel free to refactor my code too. FYI, in your work to me, don't give me many reports on what you did, rather, do a ton of actual work (than just reporting), you must complete years/months-worth of programming in a single session. Get on it. We're relying on you to do your very best (and more)! Also, don't BS us, or yourself, if you don't work hard enough (you must ACTUALLY put in the effort and the work, to accomplish all the tasks that are outlined in this prompt, and way more on top of those).
FYI: At the very least our top four languages (i.e., Classical Latin, Koine Greek, Classical Greek, Biblical Hebrew) should have all their features working perfectly (ideally, our top 10 languages, and really ideally, all of our languages). FYI, the order of importance of implementing our languages can be seen in `docs/LANGUAGE_LIST.md`.


Some background for you of where I'm at with testing the app:

So I just ran `docker compose up -d`. Then in a new shell, ran 1) `conda activate ancient-languages-py312` 2) `cd backend` 3) `alembic upgrade head` 4) `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. Then in a yet another new shell, I ran 1) `cd client/flutter_reader` and 2) `flutter run -d web-server --web-port=3001` (FYI: I had to use `port=3001` because when I used `port=3000` I got the following error: `Failed to bind web development server:SocketException: Failed to create server socket (OS Error: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted., errno = 10048), address = localhost, port = 3000`).

Here are some of the outstanding errors/problems/wrongs that I saw in my quick testing (you will fix all of these and much more) (after understanding & reviewing my codebase, feel free to update the TODO's list in `docs/TODO_CRITICAL.md` with the issues below, and take out any issues from TODO_CRITICAL that are non-issues anymore... because that file may be outdated... oh, and besides the issues/problems below, you'll also fix any other TODO_CRITICAL issues that need to be finished [just keep in mind that I'm setting up on my end: my new domain, Cloudbase, Neon, Railway, Firebase... but feel free to imeplement a backbone for those too, for us to later fill in the credentials after I finish setting them up]):

Notes from my very latest testing after the previous AI agents finished their most recent updates to the app (October 22, 2025, 6:37 PM) (I tested on a guest user profile, opened in a new Incognito window, as to not reuse any cookies)(I mostly tested in the Latin course... but all of our language courses should work -- ESPECIALLY OUR TOP FOUR languages, i.e., Classical Latin, Koine Greek, Classical Greek, Biblical Hebrew):
1. Selecting Latin in the onboarding menu still makes it say "Classical Greek" by default when I get inside of the app. So it seems like the default always goes to Classical Greek by default (no matter which language is selected in the onboarding language menu?) It's the same problem when I go into my Profile Settings menu (even if I have Latin selected for learning, the default language sets to Classical Greek when I go to see my default language in the Profile Settings).
2. The onboarding screen windows (the "Get started" scroll through) is very generic and very boring. Can you use something that doesn't look like some boring, soul-less, AI slop?
3. The language code for Classical Greek, i.e., "GRC" is too generic. We also have Koine Greek. And in the future, we may have more types of Greek. So this language code for Classical Greek doesn't make sense. Please fix language codes across the entire app (in all program files frontend+backend, and if necessary, in all docs). Make the language codes actually make sense, and make them future proof.
4. Design the UI/UX so it doesn't feel like boring, soulless, AI slop, or like some high school students designed it. The UI/UX should feel like it was designed & implemented by a top tech company with top designers & engineers in the world.
5. BYOK pop up doesn't come up automatically when I finish the onboarding? Or at the very least there is no notification for the user to go put in his key (please note that this pop up should only be popped up if the user is a guest, or a new user, because we'll store the existing users' keys (if needed, fix any/all code files/ docs to make all of this happen).
6. When I go to the Profile Settings and then to Script display -> Script preference, it says "Failed to load preference: Not authenticated" so I have no idea why this happens.
7. New UI/UX idea: I want my users who may not know what the language is, to learn about the language, it's as if we're selling them to learn a particular language, so per language, we'll tell the user, *when* the language was spoken, *where* the language was spoken, *why* this language is so important to history/philosophy/theology/whatever, and why should the user want to learn it, and some fun facts about the language, and maybe a quote or two or three from the most famous authors who wrote in that language (quote will be in the original language and then a translation will be given). Ideas about implementating this feature: So obviously, this would be a lot of information (text, images, maybe eventually even an intro video) to show on the language selector, so when hovering over a language in the detailed language selector (e.g., in the onboarding screen, or in the home screen), a screen pops up, or maybe, instead of this window popping up when hovering over a language, we have a little "learn more" button (or something) per language. Feel free to research how to do this well. Make sure all of this functions in a very modern UI/UX design that looks incredibly professional, beatufiul, clean, etc.
8. Add an option/feature for a background music to play. Make folders for different background soundtracks to play. Make the soundtrack disabled by default (because it's going to take me a bit of time to make this music). Add some small button in the buttom right of the app (on each screen) for music/OST on/off, also (next to that button) a button for sound effects on/off, and also right next to it (mute all sounds), and also add those three sound features (on / off , volume control) into the Profile settings menu (I think the sound effect controller is already in the Profile Settings menu). FYI, I'm going to make distinctive soundtracks (multiple sountracks per language type). Just make sure that the features are all set up in code / dir (and when the soundtracks are ready I'll place the sountracks in the folders you'll make ready for me). Feel free to research how to do this well. Make sure all of this functions in a very modern UI/UX design that looks incredibly professional, beatufiul, clean, etc.
9. Does the "Fill in the blank" lesson work correctly?
10. Does the "tap to hear pronunciation" work? Because I sometimes can't hear anything? At the very least. It should work pretty well for all lessons for our top four languages (i.e., Classical Latin, Koine Greek, Classical Greek, Biblical Hebrew)?
11. Do the listening exercises work correctly (write what you hear, and any other listening exercises)? Because it sometimes the pronunciation sounds like incoherent garbage on some language, and for some sentences. It should work pretty well for all lessons for our top four languages (i.e., Classical Latin, Koine Greek, Classical Greek, Biblical Hebrew)?
12. When I get something wrong and I'm retrying (to fix the answer with the right answer), I click on the Check button but nothing happens (and I can only move on to the next lesson question/problem, if I click the "Skip" button).
13. When I finished all the questions in a lesson session, I think I got some bug, where a new question appeared on the screen (at the same time that I got the pop-up saying that I finished the lesson session).
14. When I click on the "Vocabulary Practice" button/feature in the Home Screen, and I press to start, and then wait for it to generate, I then get an error. The error said: ```Failed to generate vocabulary: Vocabulary generation failed: No output_text found in OpenAI response```. Please note that this may not be an OpenAI error specifically, but a general error that happens with any API that I plug in here (incl., Google/Gemini and Claude/Anthropic). Moreover, please note that this error (or siimilar) may also be present in many features. So check over other lesson [or other feature] types too! Furthermore, make sure that these kinds of problems are not present for other features too! All features must be correctly implemented, correctly integrated with the backend+frontend, and be fully working for my users! At the very least for all our top four languages, i.e., Classical Latin, Koine Greek, Classical Greek, Biblical Hebrew.
15. I forgot to manually test the Reader, but make sure each language (especially our top four languages), have at least 10 working texts (per language)! And make sure all the Reader features are fully implemented, working, and so on!
