1)🏺 Classical Greek — ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΓΛΩΤΤΑ: Encode only the 24 Ionian/Eucleidean letters in capitals (Α–Ω). Always encode sigma as Σ; do not encode lunate sigma (Ϲ/ϲ)—use Σ and let fonts provide lunate/uncial shapes when desired. Default to scriptio continua (no spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, or editorial ligatures). Strip all polytonic marks (accents, breathings); treat iota-subscript as a medieval editorial device—drop it by default; expose an “adscript-when-attested” toggle that writes an explicit Ι only where a cited witness shows adscript. Punctuation is witness-driven and minimal: if a raised dot is present, output GREEK ANO TELEIA U+0387 (note: U+0387 is canonically equivalent to U+00B7; preserve the Greek code point at render time); do not introduce a semicolon-question-mark convention. Numbers: spell out by default; a “Greek numerals” toggle may enable Milesian/Ionian numerals using keraia marks (right/dexia U+0374 and left/aristeri U+0375 for thousands) with an optional overline U+0305; include stigma Ϛ/ϛ (6), archaic koppa Ϟ/ϟ (90), and sampi Ϡ/ϡ (900). Optionally support Attic (acrophonic) numerals via the Ancient Greek Numbers block U+10140–U+1018F. Implementation cautions: guard normalization—U+037E (Greek question mark) is canonically equivalent to U+003B (semicolon), U+0387 (ano teleia) to U+00B7 (middle dot), and U+0374 (Greek numeral sign) has a compatibility mapping to U+02B9; if any Unicode normalization is unavoidable, remap at render so historical punctuation and numeral signs survive; disable any automatic “Greek semicolon = question mark” heuristics in this mode; rely on fonts for uncial/lunate styling only.

2)🏛️ Classical Latin — LINGVA LATINA: Present text in Roman capitals with the classical inventory A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z. Normalize input J→I, U→V, W→VV; map Æ/Œ→AE/OE. Use Y and Z primarily for Greek loans; Q occurs only as QV; retain K only where epigraphically fixed (e.g., KALENDAE, praenomen K.). Default to scriptio continua; optionally expose an “Epigraphic divider” toggle that inserts an interpunct (· U+00B7) as a word divider (a triangular point is a glyphic variant). Do not use macrons/breves; if vowel length must be surfaced, offer an “apex mode” that renders a long-vowel apex (no dedicated Unicode apex; approximate with a combining acute U+0301 and/or a font feature); optionally allow the epigraphic long I (LATIN EPIGRAPHIC LETTER I LONGA U+A7FE) in capitals. Greek loans should use PH/TH/CH and initial RH. Numerals are Roman only; provide a style toggle: “additive/epigraphic” (e.g., IIII, VIIII) vs “subtractive/classical” (IV, IX)—both attested. Implementation cautions: prevent typographic ligature synthesis and any re-introduction of J/U/W or modern punctuation; enforce the letter inventory strictly; if dividers are shown, use U+00B7 rather than modern punctuation.

3)  🪲 Old Egyptian (Old Kingdom) — 𓂋𓈖 𓎡𓅓𓏏: Display text using monumental Old Kingdom hieroglyphs. The default reading direction must be right-to-left, with signs oriented to face the beginning of the line (the right). Also support a vertical top-to-bottom layout, with columns progressing from right to left. Enforce proper quadrat grouping of signs. The writing system is purely logographic, phonetic, and determinative; do not insert any vowels, modern punctuation, or word spaces. All editorial markers, such as brackets or dots, must be forbidden. Numerals must be rendered using the Egyptian hieroglyphic tally system for powers of ten (1, 10, 100, 1,000, etc.) and not with Arabic digits.

4)  🕉️ Vedic Sanskrit — वैदिक संस्कृतम्: Encode text in Devanāgarī, but ensure it is strictly configured for Vedic conventions, not Classical or modern Sanskrit. The most critical rule is to preserve and accurately render all Vedic pitch accent marks: the *anudātta* (a horizontal bar below the syllable, U+0952), the *udātta* (unmarked), and the *svarita* (a vertical stroke above the syllable, U+0951), as well as more complex marks from the Vedic Extensions block (U+1CD0–U+1CFF). Forbid all Western punctuation. The only valid punctuation marks are the *danda* (। U+0964) and *double danda* (॥ U+0965) to mark the end of verses or sections, as attested in manuscripts. Do not introduce hyphens; represent sandhi as a continuous string of characters. The *avagraha* (ऽ) should only be used if it is explicitly present in the source manuscript, not added editorially. All numbers must be spelled out.

5)📖 Koine Greek — ΚΟΙΝΗ ΔΙΑΛΕΚΤΟΣ: Same 24 letters in capitals (Α–Ω), with any uncial look left to fonts; encode sigma only as Σ (never Ϲ/ϲ). Use scriptio continua; forbid hyphens/apostrophes/ligature synthesis. Strip accents and breathings entirely; treat iota-subscript as medieval—drop it by default; expose an “adscript-when-attested” toggle (Ι) per witness. Punctuation is minimal and strictly witness-driven: if a raised dot occurs, output U+0387 (preserve against normalization to U+00B7); do not treat semicolon as a question mark in this mode. Permit diaeresis (Ϊ/Ϋ or combining ◌̈) only where a genuine hiatus is shown in a witness (e.g., initial Ι/Υ in uncial manuscripts). Numbers: spelled out by default; optional Milesian/Ionian numerals using U+0374/U+0375 with optional overline U+0305 and the numeral letters stigma/koppa/sampi as above; optionally support Attic/acrophonic numerals U+10140–U+1018F. Optional “Manuscript mode” (off by default) may overline nomina sacra (curated set such as ΙΣ/ΙΗΣ, ΧΣ, ΘΣ, ΚΣ, ΠΝΑ with case endings) using a real overbar spanning the contraction (render-level rule or U+0305 across the span); do not encode lunate sigma or non-textual ligatures. Implementation cautions: same normalization guards as for Classical Greek; rely on fonts for uncial forms; keep diaeresis strictly witness-based.

6)  🔆 Ancient Sumerian — 𒅴𒂠: Render text using the appropriate Sumerian cuneiform sign inventory for the period (e.g., Ur III, Old Babylonian). The layout must be left-to-right in horizontal lines, reflecting the shift from the original vertical column layout. Prohibit all modern punctuation and spacing. Determinatives, logograms, and phonetic signs must be preserved exactly as they appear in the source text, with no editorial brackets or superscripts added. The traditional small vertical wedge (DIŠ, 𒁹) may be used as a word divider only if it is attested in the source tablet; otherwise, maintain *scriptio continua*. Numerals must be displayed using the sexagesimal (base-60) cuneiform system, including the proper place-value notation and specific signs for 1 and 10; forbid Arabic digits.

7)  🍎 Yehudit (Paleo-Hebrew script) — 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤃𐤉𐤕: Use the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which is a variant of the Phoenician script. The writing direction must be strictly right-to-left. This is a pure *abjad* (consonantal alphabet); do not add any vowel markings, including Masoretic *niqqud* or cantillation marks. The use of *matres lectionis* (consonants used as vowel indicators, e.g., 𐤅 for /o/ or /u/) must strictly follow the orthography of the source inscription. Forbid all Western punctuation. Word division, if present in the source artifact, should be represented by a single small dot or a short vertical tick; otherwise, all text must be rendered in *scriptio continua*. Numbers must be spelled out. Absolutely avoid the later square Aramaic (Ashuri) script.

8)  ☦️ Old Church Slavonic — ⰔⰎⰑⰂⰡⰐⰟ ⰟⰸⰟⰽ (СЛОВѢНЬСКЪ ѨЗЫКЪ): The primary and most authentic script to use is Glagolitic, specifically the early "round" form. An alternative mode for early Cyrillic should use the *ustav* (uncial) script. In either mode, there is no case distinction; use only the majuscule forms. A crucial element is the *titlo* (a combining overline, U+0483) which must be placed over letters to indicate abbreviation (especially for *nomina sacra*) and to mark letters being used as numerals. Punctuation must be restricted to what is found in early manuscripts: typically a middle or high dot (·) for pauses and decorated paragraph marks. Forbid modern commas, semicolons, and quotes. All numbers must be represented by letters with a *titlo* above them. Preserve the full archaic letter inventory, including the yers (Ъ/Ь), yuses (Ѧ/Ѫ), yat (Ѣ), izhitsa (Ѵ), and fita (Ѳ); do not normalize these to later Russian or other Slavic orthographies.

9)  🔥 Avestan — 𐬀𐬬𐬆𐬯𐬙𐬁: Display text using the Avestan alphabet, which was specifically invented for the language and includes full vowel representation. The direction is right-to-left. There is no case distinction. Words must be separated by the Avestan word-separator dot (a small dot or triangle, depending on font). No other punctuation is historically attested. It is critical to preserve the script's complex ligatures and conjuncts as they are fundamental to its orthography. Do not substitute Latin or Perso-Arabic characters. All numbers must be spelled out.

10) ☸️ Pali — पाळि: Represent Pali using a historically appropriate early Indic script, with Brahmi being the most ancient choice. Other valid, period-appropriate scripts include early Sinhala, Grantha, or Burmese, depending on the manuscript tradition being presented. The default writing style should be *scriptio continua* with minimal spacing. The only permitted punctuation marks are the *danda* (।) and *double danda* (॥) for marking the end of verses or sentences. Prohibit all Western punctuation. Do not editorially introduce Sanskrit-specific features like *visarga* or *avagraha* unless they are explicitly part of the Pali manuscript witness. Numbers must be spelled out; if digits are required by a source, use the numerals native to the chosen script (e.g., Brahmi numerals), not Arabic digits.

11) 🕎 Biblical Hebrew — עִבְרִית מִקְרָאִית: Display text using the unpointed square Hebrew script (Ketav Ashuri). The direction must be right-to-left. The core rule for authenticity is to remove all Masoretic additions: this includes all vowel points (*niqqud*) and cantillation marks (*te'amim*). Punctuation like the *maqaf* (hyphen), *sof pasuq* (verse ender), and any modern punctuation (commas, periods, question marks) must be forbidden. Words should be separated by a simple space only. The orthography of the consonantal text, including the use of *matres lectionis* (waw/yod), must be preserved exactly as it appears in the witness text (e.g., the Leningrad Codex consonantal layer) without any normalization. Numbers must be spelled out.

12) 🗣️ Ancient Aramaic — 𐡀𐡓𐡌𐡉𐡕: Use the Imperial Aramaic consonantal script, with a strict right-to-left direction. As an *abjad*, it must be displayed without any vowel points or later Syriac diacritics. Prohibit all Western punctuation. Word separation should only occur if the source manuscript or inscription shows a specific divider, typically a dot or small space; otherwise, render the text continuously. The use of *matres lectionis* (consonants as vowel indicators) must be preserved exactly as attested in the source. Numbers should be spelled out or, if the source uses them, rendered with traditional numerical strokes. Forbid Arabic digits.

13) 🪷 Classical Sanskrit — संस्कृतम्: Render text in Devanāgarī (or a historically appropriate regional script like Nāgarī or Grantha). The default mode must be *scriptio continua*, where words are joined according to the rules of *sandhi*, reflecting how they are written in manuscripts. The only permitted punctuation is the *danda* (। U+0964) and *double danda* (॥ U+0965) to terminate half-verses, verses, or sentences. Forbid all editorial hyphens, Western punctuation, and quotation marks. The *avagraha* (ऽ) should only be displayed when it is present in the source witness, not introduced as a modern editorial convention. All numbers must be spelled out. The representation of conjunct consonants (*samyuktākṣara*) must be accurate.

14) 🏹 Akkadian — 𒀝𒅗𒁺𒌑: Display text using the Mesopotamian cuneiform script, adapted for the Akkadian language (e.g., Old Babylonian, Neo-Assyrian styles). The layout is left-to-right. Prohibit all modern punctuation. A small vertical wedge may be used as a word divider only when explicitly present in the source tablet. Preserve Sumerograms (logograms borrowed from Sumerian) and determinatives exactly as written, without adding modern editorial glosses, brackets, or capitalization changes. Numerals must be rendered using the sexagesimal (base-60) cuneiform system with proper place-value notation.

15) 🪓 Old Norse (Norrœnt mál) — ᚾᚢᚱᚱᛅᚾᛏ ᛘᛅᛚ: For manuscript sources (12th–13th century), use the medieval Latin script. There is no case distinction. The alphabet includes specific Norse characters like thorn (þ) and eth (ð), as well as vowel representations like æ and ǫ (often written with an o-caudata, ꝫ). Orthography must strictly follow the manuscript witness; do not normalize spellings to a modern standard (e.g., do not regularize the use of ð/þ). Punctuation is limited to manuscript practices: the *punctus* (a middle dot for pauses) and potentially the *punctus elevatus* or *punctus interrogativus*. The Tironian note *et* (⁊) must be used for "and" (*ok*) where attested. Numbers are either spelled out or written in Roman numerals, following the source.

16) 👁️ Middle Egyptian — 𓂋𓈖 𓎡𓅓𐓏: Use Middle Egyptian monumental hieroglyphs with canonical quadrat grouping. The primary layout is right-to-left (with signs facing right), with an alternative vertical top-to-bottom layout. The writing is logosyllabic; do not insert vowels, word spaces, or modern punctuation. Preserve logograms, phonograms, and determinatives precisely as attested, without any editorial brackets or notations. Provide a toggle to display text in hieratic (the cursive script) only if you are rendering a text from a specific hieratic source (e.g., a papyrus). Numerals must use the traditional hieroglyphic tally system.

17) 🪢 Old English — ᛖᚾᚷᛚᛁᛋᚳ: Render text using the Insular Latin alphabet. Key characters to include are thorn (þ), eth (ð), wynn (ƿ), and ash (æ). Ensure the use of the distinct Insular 'g' glyph (looking like a flat-topped 's' with a closed loop below). There is no typographic distinction between 'u' and 'v', or 'i' and 'j'. 'w' should be represented by wynn (ƿ). Writing should be presented with minimal spacing between words, approaching *scriptio continua*, or with a simple middle dot as a separator if attested. Punctuation is limited to the *punctus* (dot) for pauses. Forbid all modern spellings, punctuation, and capitalization conventions. Numbers should be Roman or spelled out per the witness.

18) 🐉 Classical Chinese — 文言文: Display text using traditional Han characters (繁體字). The default layout must be vertical, with columns running from top-to-bottom, and the columns themselves progressing from right-to-left. The most authentic representation forbids all punctuation and word spacing. Do not add modern marks like commas, periods, or quotation marks unless you are explicitly reproducing a specific, much later punctuated edition. Preserve variant character forms (異體字) as found in the source text; do not normalize them to modern standardized forms or simplified characters (简体字). Numbers must be rendered using Chinese numeral characters (e.g., 一, 二, 三, 十, 百).

19) ⚖️ Coptic (Sahidic) — ⲧⲙⲛ̄ⲧⲣⲙ̄ⲛ̄ⲕⲏⲙⲉ: Use the Coptic alphabet, which consists of Greek-derived letters plus six or seven letters from Demotic Egyptian. There is no case distinction in early manuscripts. A critical feature to render is the supralinear stroke (a combining overline), used to indicate abbreviations, especially *nomina sacra* (e.g., ⲓ̅ⲥ̅ for Ἰησοῦς) and syllables with a syllabic consonant. Word spacing should be minimal or absent. Punctuation is limited to an ancient middle or high dot and decorated paragraph markers (*coronis*). Forbid all Western punctuation. Numbers are written using the Greek numeral system (letters with a supralinear stroke). Preserve dialect-specific spellings (e.g., Sahidic vs. Bohairic) without normalization.

20) 🐂️ Hittite — 𒉈𒅆𒇷: Display text using the Mesopotamian cuneiform script as adapted by the Hittites (a syllabary with Sumerian and Akkadian logograms). The layout is left-to-right. Forbid modern punctuation. The cuneiform word-divider wedge (a small vertical tick) should be used between words only when present in the source tablet. It is essential to retain Sumerograms and Akkadograms (written in capitals in modern transliteration) and Hittite phonetic complements exactly as they appear in the cuneiform, without adding editorial brackets or glosses. Numerals must be rendered in cuneiform.

21) 🐆 Classical Nahuatl — Nāhuatlāhtōlli: Use the 16th-century Spanish-based orthography found in early colonial sources. This system uses `c`/`qu` for /k/, `hu`/`uh` for /w/, `x` for /ʃ/, and digraphs like `tz` and `tl`. There are no `k` or `w` letters. The glottal stop (*saltillo*) was represented inconsistently, often with an `h` or a circumflex accent over the preceding vowel; you must follow the convention of the source manuscript and not normalize it to the modern apostrophe. Do not add modern accent marks for stress. Punctuation is sparse, typically limited to periods or colons from the source; otherwise, use minimal word spacing. Numbers should be spelled out or rendered in Roman numerals if the witness uses them.

22) 🏔️ Classical Tibetan — ཆོས་སྐད།: Render text using the Uchen (dbu can) script. The fundamental rule of Tibetan orthography is that every syllable must be followed by a *tsheg* (་), a dot-like mark that functions as a syllable divider. This rule is mandatory. Clauses or sentences are terminated by a *shad* (།), a single vertical bar. The end of a whole text or major section is marked by a *nyis shad* (༎), a double vertical bar. Do not use any Western punctuation. Preserve the complex consonant stacking system (head-letters, subjoined letters, etc.) precisely as in the witness. Numbers should be represented with Tibetan digits (U+0F20–U+0F29) only when the source text uses them; otherwise, they are spelled out.

23) 🗻 Old Japanese — 上代日本語: The only authentic representation is *Man'yōgana*, which uses Chinese characters for their phonetic (and sometimes semantic) values. The layout must be vertical, with columns running from right-to-left. There is no hiragana or katakana. Forbid all punctuation and word spacing. The specific character choices for phonetic values must be preserved exactly as they appear in the source text (e.g., the Man'yōshū), as these choices were often stylistic and meaningful. Do not normalize the orthography to later kana spellings. Numbers, when present, use Chinese numeral characters.

24) 🦙 Classical Quechua — Runa Simi: Use the 16th/17th-century colonial orthography developed by Spanish missionaries. This system is typically a 3-vowel system (`a, i, u`) and uses Spanish conventions like `c`/`qu` for /k/, `hu` for /w/, `ll` for /ʎ/, and `ñ` for /ɲ/. Ejective and aspirated stops were often not distinguished from plain stops; do not add modern diacritics (like apostrophes or 'h') to represent them unless they are in the source. Punctuation is sparse and limited to what is in the source (usually periods/colons). Numbers are spelled out or written as Roman numerals per the witness text. Do not normalize spellings to any modern 5-vowel or standardized Quechua orthography.

25) 🌙 Classical Arabic — العربية الفصحى: For maximum authenticity, display text using the early Qur’ānic *rasm* (the consonantal skeleton). This requires stripping all vowel marks (*ḥarakāt*) and, by default, all consonantal diacritical dots (*i‘jām*) that distinguish letters like ب, ت, ث. A toggle may allow displaying dots if a specific early manuscript tradition (which includes them) is being shown. Forbid the use of *tatweel* (kashida) for justification. Use minimal word spacing. Prohibit all modern punctuation. Verse or section ends should only be marked with manuscript-style separators if present in the source. Do not normalize orthography, especially regarding the representation of the *hamza* or the form of *tā’ marbūṭa*. Numbers must be spelled out.

26) ✝️ Classical Syriac — ܠܫܢܐ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ: The primary script for this period is Estrangelā (ܐܣܛܪܢܓܠܐ). The text direction is right-to-left. By default, suppress all later vowel pointing systems (both Eastern and Western forms). Punctuation is minimal and should be limited to what is found in early manuscripts: a single dot placed high, low, or in the middle to indicate pauses of different lengths, and potentially a four-dot arrangement (܁) to mark the end of a paragraph. A combining overline may be used to mark abbreviations or numerals where attested. Do not use later Serto or East Syriac letterforms unless a specific witness in that hand is being reproduced. Numbers should be spelled out or written with letter-numerals using an overline.

27) 🪙 Middle Persian (Pahlavi) — 𐭯𐭠𐭫𐭮𐭩𐭪: Use either Inscriptional Pahlavi or Book Pahlavi script, depending on the source. The direction is right-to-left. This script is an *abjad* with inherent ambiguity and mandatory ligatures; do not add vowel marks or attempt to disambiguate letters beyond what the script itself provides. Word separation can be minimal or non-existent in inscriptions; Book Pahlavi may use dots or short strokes as dividers only where attested. Prohibit Western punctuation. Numbers should be represented by their own Pahlavi letter-based numeral system or spelled out.

28) ☘️ Old Irish — ᚛ᚌᚑᚔᚓᚂᚉ᚜: Provide two modes. The primary "Epigraphic Mode" must use the Ogham script. This is written vertically along a stemline, read from bottom-to-top (or left-to-right if written horizontally). It must begin with an OGHAM START MARK (᚛) and end with an OGHAM END MARK (᚜). Use the OGHAM SPACE MARK ( ) for word division if needed; otherwise, it is continuous. For a "Manuscript Mode", use the Insular Latin alphabet. A critical feature is the use of a *punctus delens* (a dot placed over a letter, using a combining dot above U+0307) to indicate lenition, but only where the manuscript shows it (do not editorially add it or normalize it to a following 'h'). Punctuation is limited to a middle dot (*punctus*).

29) ⚔️ Gothic — 𐌲𐌿𐍄𐌹𐍃𐌺𐌰 𐍂𐌰𐌶𐌳𐌰: Display text using the Gothic alphabet. There is no case distinction. Words must be separated by a middle dot (interpunct · U+00B7), following the convention of the Codex Argenteus. Major pauses or sentence ends should be marked with a colon-like double dot. Prohibit all other Western punctuation. The use of a diaeresis (trema) on the letter 'i' (e.g., ï) at the beginning of a word or after a vowel should be preserved only where the manuscript witness shows it. A supralinear stroke (overline) indicates numerals or abbreviations. Do not substitute Latin letters for Gothic ones (e.g., 'g' for 𐌲).

30) 🦁 Geʽez — ግዕዝ: Render text using the Ethiopic fidel (syllabary), where each character represents a consonant+vowel pair. There is no case distinction. The mandatory word separator is the Ethiopic wordspace, which looks like a colon (፡ U+1361). Sentences must end with the Ethiopic full stop (። U+1362). Other traditional clause separators (፤, ፣, ፥) should be used only as attested in the source text. Forbid all Latin punctuation. Numbers must be rendered using the Ethiopic numeral system (U+1369–U+137C).

31) 🪔 Classical Tamil — செந்தமிழ்: Use the Tamil script. Writing should be nearly continuous. The *puḷḷi* (a dot above the letter, corresponding to virama U+0BCD) is used to suppress the inherent /a/ vowel and create pure consonants, and its usage must be preserved accurately. The special character *āytam* (ஃ U+0B83) must be used only where explicitly attested. Forbid all Western punctuation and do not introduce modern word spacing conventions. Numbers should be spelled out or, if the witness contains them, rendered using Tamil digits (U+0BE6–U+0BEF). Do not introduce Grantha letters unless the source text (which might be quoting Sanskrit) explicitly uses them.

32) 🦅 Classical Armenian — ԳՐԱԲԱՐ: Use the Armenian alphabet, rendered in its original uncial (majuscule) form known as *erkat'agir* (երկաթագիր). There is no lowercase. Punctuation must be strictly Armenian: the full stop is the *verjaket* (։ U+0589), which looks like a colon. Other period-appropriate marks include the comma-like *bowt'* (՝ U+055D) and the question mark *hartsakan nshan* (՞ U+055E), which is placed over the stressed vowel of the question's key word, not at the end of the sentence. Prohibit Latin punctuation. Numbers must be written using the Armenian letter-numeral system (e.g., Ա=1, Բ=2), often marked with an overline. Preserve original orthography (e.g., the pre-reform distinction between յ/հ).

33) 🌌 Sogdian — 𐼼𐼴𐼶𐼹𐼷𐼸: Use the Sogdian alphabet (the "formal" or "sutra" script) in a right-to-left direction. This is a cursive script where many letters connect. Word separation should be minimal or marked with a small dot or double dot only if attested in the manuscript. Do not add vowel diacritics beyond the inherent *matres lectionis* (aleph, yodh, waw). Forbid all Western punctuation. Numbers should be spelled out or rendered with their letter values per manuscript convention.

34) 🌄 Ugaritic — 𐎜𐎂𐎗𐎚: Use the Ugaritic cuneiform alphabet, a unique alphabetic (not syllabic) cuneiform script. The direction must be left-to-right. The only valid separator is the Ugaritic word divider (𐎟 U+1039F), a small vertical wedge, which must be placed between every word. No other punctuation is used. Preserve the 30 alphabetic signs exactly as written.

35) 🐫 Tocharian A (Ārśi) — Ārśi: Render text using the North Turkestan Brahmi script (sometimes called "slanting Brahmi"). The direction is left-to-right. The default writing style is *scriptio continua*. The only permitted punctuation is the *danda* (।) and *double danda* (॥) at the end of sentences or verses, if attested. Preserve the script's specific conjunct forms and vowel diacritics exactly as in the witness. Numbers should be spelled out or rendered with Brahmi numerals.

36) 🛕 Tocharian B (Kuśiññe) — Kuśiññe: Render text using the same North Turkestan Brahmi script conventions as Tocharian A. The direction is left-to-right and the default is *scriptio continua*. The only allowed punctuation is the Indic *danda* (।) and *double danda* (॥) when present in the manuscript. Preserve the specific orthographic conventions of Tocharian B, which differ slightly from A. Numerals must be spelled out or rendered in Brahmi digits as attested.

— Partial courses —

1)  ⚱️ Etruscan — 𐌀𐌍𐌔𐌀𐌓: Use the Old Italic alphabet (Etruscan variant). The writing direction is primarily right-to-left. There is no case distinction and no J, U, or W. Words are often separated by an interpunct (·) or a colon-like double dot (:). If no divider is present in the source inscription, render continuously. Preserve the witness's use of K/C/Q, as their distribution was phonologically significant. Numerals are additive Italic/Roman forms (e.g., IIII, never IV).

2)  🏞 Proto-Norse (Elder Futhark) — ᚢᚾᚨᚱᚨᛒᚨᚾᚨᛉ: Use the 24-rune Elder Futhark. The writing direction can vary (right-to-left, left-to-right, or boustrophedon), and should follow the source inscription. There is no case distinction. Word division is inconsistent; if present, it is usually marked by a single, double, or triple dot separator (᛬). If no separator is present, the text is continuous. Allow for bind-runes (ligatures of two or more runes) only where they are explicitly attested in the source artifact.

3)  🐍 Elamite — 𒁹𒄬𒆷𒁶𒋾: Use Elamite cuneiform (the late, simplified syllabary). The writing direction is left-to-right. Forbid modern punctuation. A vertical wedge may be used as a word divider where tablets show it. Preserve logograms and determinatives borrowed from Akkadian. Numbers are rendered in cuneiform signs.

4)  ⛈️ Runic Old Norse (Younger Futhark) — ᚾᚢᚱᛅᚾᛏ ᛘᛅᛚ: Use the 16-rune Younger Futhark. Provide a toggle for long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish-Norwegian) variants. The direction is typically left-to-right. Word dividers are common and should be represented by one or more dots (᛬). If no divider is present, text is continuous. Allow bind-runes only where attested. No case distinction and no Western punctuation.

5)  👑 Old Persian (Ariya) — 𐎠𐎼𐎡𐎹: Use the Old Persian cuneiform script. The direction is left-to-right. This is a semi-alphabetic syllabary. It has a dedicated word divider character (𐏐 U+103D0), which must be inserted between all words. Preserve the script's few logograms (for concepts like "king" or "country") where they appear. Numerals are rendered with their own specific cuneiform signs.

6)  🌽 Classic Maya (Chʼoltiʼ): Use Maya hieroglyphs, arranging logosyllabic signs into quadrat blocks. The overall reading order is in paired columns, reading the first block in the left column, the first in the right column, then the second in the left, second in the right, and so on. Inside each block, the reading order is generally top-to-bottom and left-to-right. Forbid all Western punctuation and spacing between blocks. Numbers must be rendered with the Maya dot-and-bar system.

7)  🐺 Old Turkic (Orkhon) — 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰: Use the Old Turkic (Orkhon) script. The direction is right-to-left. A colon-like symbol (U+205A) is used as the word separator and is mandatory between all words. Preserve the script's internal vowel harmony rules (e.g., using specific consonant signs for front-vowel vs. back-vowel words). Do not substitute Latin letters.

8)  ⛵ Phoenician (Canaanite) — 𐤃𐤁𐤓𐤉𐤌 𐤊𐤍𐤏𐤍𐤉𐤌: Use the Phoenician consonantal alphabet, with a strict right-to-left direction. This is a pure *abjad* with no vowel representation. Prohibit all modern punctuation. Words may be separated by the Phoenician word separator (𐤟 U+1091F) or a simple middle dot, but only if the source inscription shows it. Otherwise, text is continuous.

9)  🐏 Moabite — 𐤌𐤀𐤁𐤉𐤕: Use the Canaanite alphabet with a Moabite ductus (style), which is very similar to Phoenician and Paleo-Hebrew. The direction is right-to-left. It is a pure *abjad*. Forbid Western punctuation. Word division is marked by a single dot where attested (as on the Mesha Stele); otherwise, text is continuous.

10) ⚓ Punic (Carthaginian) — 𐤃𐤁𐤓𐤉𐤌 𐤐𐤍𐤉𐤌: Use the Phoenician alphabet, evolving into the more cursive Punic and Neo-Punic forms for later texts. The direction is right-to-left and it remains a vowel-less *abjad* (though late Neo-Punic added weak vowel indication with *matres lectionis*). Word separator dots should only be used when attested. Default to monumental Phoenician forms unless a later, cursive witness is being reproduced.
