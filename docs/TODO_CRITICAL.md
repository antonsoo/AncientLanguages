## 🟡 REMAINING (Minor Polish Items)

### 1. Sound Effects Quality

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Polish)

**Status:** NOT CRITICAL, BUT NICE TO HAVE

**User feedback:**
- Error sound feels "old computer-ish"
- Other sounds are placeholder quality

**Solution:**
Replace these files with better quality, non-copyrighted sounds:
```
client/flutter_reader/assets/sounds/error.wav
client/flutter_reader/assets/sounds/success.wav
client/flutter_reader/assets/sounds/tap.wav
client/flutter_reader/assets/sounds/whoosh.wav
```

**Resources for free sounds:**
- https://freesound.org/ (CC0 license)
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/ (attribution required)

**Criteria:**
- Professional quality
- Not annoying
- Small file size (<50KB each)
- Non-copyrighted (CC0 or similar)

---

### 2. Reader Default Text Language

**Priority:** LOW (Minor UX)

**Status:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**User reported:**
- Default text in Reader might be in English instead of target language
- Need to verify this is actually an issue
- If real, fix reading_page.dart placeholder text

---

### 3. Reader Text Library Content

**Priority:** LOW (Content work, not bugs)

**Status:** ONGOING

**User wants:**
- 10+ texts for Classical Greek
- Multiple texts for other top languages
- Better book selection UI

**Notes:**
- This is content work, not coding
- Texts stored in database (TextWork model)
- Can be added later without code changes

---

### 4. History Page Functionality

**Priority:** LOW

**Status:** NEEDS TESTING

**User concern:**
- May be broken for non-signed-in users
- Needs manual testing to verify

---
