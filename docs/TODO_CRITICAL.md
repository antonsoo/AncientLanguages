## üéØ HIGHEST PRIORITY - ACTUALLY CODE THESE

### 1. **Integrate Premium Widgets Into Remaining Pages** (30-60 min)

‚úÖ Already integrated in 6 pages (passage_selection, pro_history, progress_stats, settings, text_structure, vibrant_profile)

**Remaining pages needing integration:**
```
enhanced_history_page.dart     - Use PremiumListAnimation
pro_lessons_page.dart          - Use Premium3DAnimations (has retry logic, needs animations)
```

**Widget imports available:**
```dart
import '../widgets/premium_celebrations.dart';
import '../widgets/premium_progress_animations.dart';
import '../widgets/premium_3d_animations.dart';
import '../widgets/premium_micro_interactions.dart';
import '../widgets/premium_parallax.dart';
import '../widgets/premium_fab_menu.dart';
import '../widgets/premium_list_animations.dart';
```

### 2. **Test App End-to-End in Browser** (30 min - 1 hour)

**CRITICAL:** The app has NEVER been tested in a browser this session!

**Steps:**
1. Start backend: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts\dev\smoke_lessons.ps1"`
2. Start frontend: `cd client/flutter_reader && flutter run -d web-server --web-port=3000`
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. Click through EVERY feature and FIX BUGS FOUND

### 3. **Fix the 5 Failing Tests**

Current: 100 passing, 3 skipped, 5 failing
Run `flutter test` and investigate failures

---

### 4. **Test All 46 Languages** (1-2 hours)

**Current:** Tested 38/46 languages successfully (83%)
**Status:**
- ‚úÖ 38 languages working (including nci, qwh after YAML boolean fix)
- ‚ùå 8 languages have YAML syntax errors in seed files: sog, otk, ett, gmq-pro, non-rune, elx, obm, xpu
**Needed:** Fix YAML syntax in 8 failing language seed files

```bash
# Test with Echo provider (free, instant)
for lang in lat grc hbo san pli non ang arc ara syc akk cop egy sux ltc tam chu ave nah bod jpn que pal arm hit;
do
  curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:62590/lesson/generate" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"language\":\"$lang\",\"profile\":\"beginner\",\"provider\":\"echo\"}" | jq '.tasks[0].type'
done
```

---

## üîß HIGH PRIORITY - BACKEND

### 5. **Fix Phonetic Transcriptions**
- **File:** `backend/app/lesson/providers/echo.py:1170`
- **Current:** `phonetic_guide=None` (TODO comment exists)
- **Needed:** Add IPA phonetic guides for non-Latin scripts
- **Impact:** Better pronunciation learning

---

### 6. **Verify LANGUAGE_WRITING_RULES.md**
- **User said:** "The language rules list was a bit wrong. I just fixed it up."
- **Check:** Compare with LANGUAGE_LIST.md, ensure all 46 languages have correct rules

---

## üì± MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 7. **Deploy Web Build** (30 min)
- **Current:** Build exists at `client/flutter_reader/build/web/`
- **Deploy to:** Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase
- **Get shareable link** for investors

---

## ‚úÖ ACTUALLY COMPLETED (No BS)

**Backend:**
- ‚úÖ 46 languages configured
- ‚úÖ Echo provider works
- ‚úÖ OpenAI, Anthropic, Google providers VERIFIED WORKING (tested this session!)
- ‚úÖ Text reader with morphology
- ‚úÖ SRS backend (FSRS)
- ‚úÖ Chat personas
- ‚úÖ TTS providers
- ‚úÖ Gamification backend
- ‚úÖ Database schema

- ‚úÖ Premium UI components created (buttons, snackbars, cards, animations)
- ‚úÖ **7 premium widget libraries created** (~2,500 lines - this session!)
- ‚úÖ Web build compiles successfully

---

## ‚ùå NOT COMPLETED (Be Honest)

- ‚ùå 2 pages still need premium widget integration (enhanced_history, pro_lessons)
- ‚ùå App NOT tested end-to-end in browser across all sessions
- ‚ùå Only 38 of 46 languages tested (8 have YAML syntax errors)
- ‚ùå 5 tests still failing
- ‚ùå Not deployed publicly
- ‚ùå Phonetic guides still missing

**BRUTAL TRUTH:**
- Code quality excellent (0 warnings, 95% tests passing)
- Backend verified working (3 AI providers tested successfully)
- Premium widgets 75% integrated (6 of 8 pages)
- New features added: vocabulary review, progress charts, achievements, lesson retry
- App likely works but NOT TESTED in browser
- About 90% ready - needs final integration, testing, deployment

---

## üí° FOR NEXT AGENT - BE SMART

**PRIORITY ORDER:**

1. **Integrate premium widgets** into the 8 pages (1-2 hours max)
   - Don't create new widgets, use the ones that already exist!
   - Import them and wrap existing components
   - Test each page in browser after integrating

2. **Test app end-to-end** in browser (30 min - 1 hour)
   - Actually click through features
   - Document any bugs found
   - Fix the bugs

3. **Test all 46 languages** (1-2 hours)
   - Use the script above
   - Verify each language generates valid lessons

4. **Deploy to Netlify** (30 min)
   - Get a shareable link

**What NOT to do:**
- ‚ùå Don't create MORE widget files
- ‚ùå Don't write reports claiming "ALL DONE"
- ‚ùå Don't create new documentation
- ‚ùå Don't waste time on polish

**What TO do:**
- ‚úÖ Use existing widgets in existing pages
- ‚úÖ Test features in the browser
- ‚úÖ Fix bugs you find
- ‚úÖ Deploy the web build
