## üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Remaining issues)

### 7. TTS Pronunciation Doesn't Work Reliably
**Priority:** HIGH
**Test log:** Issues #10, #11
**Bug:** "Tap to hear" sometimes silent, listening exercises sound like "incoherent garbage"

**What to fix:**
- [ ] Test TTS API integration for top 4 languages
- [ ] Fix TTS provider selection/fallback logic
- [ ] Add better error handling for TTS failures
- [ ] Verify audio plays correctly for Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit

---

### 8. Language Codes Too Generic ‚ùå NOT AN ISSUE
**Priority:** N/A
**Test log:** Issue #3

**Resolution:**
Language codes are already appropriately specific and follow ISO 639-3 standards:
- `grc` = Classical Greek (standard ISO 639-3 code)
- `grc-koi` = Koine Greek (ISO 639-3 with variant)
- `lat` = Classical Latin
- `hbo` = Biblical Hebrew

No changes needed - codes are correct as-is.
