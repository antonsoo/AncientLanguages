# Critical TODOs - What Actually Needs CODING

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025 (Evening Session)
**Database:** 77/77 language seed files exist ‚úì
**Critical Bugs:** Fixed ‚úì
**Recent Work:** Skill tree real data, Echo provider fix, interactive text reading

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Oct 19, Evening Session)

### 1. **Skill Tree Real Data** ‚úÖ DONE
- **Was:** Showing 10 hardcoded fake lessons
- **Now:** Shows actual completed lessons from LessonHistoryStore
- **File:** `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/skill_tree_page.dart`
- **Impact:** No longer looks fake in demos

### 2. **Echo Provider Scriptio Continua Bug** ‚úÖ DONE
- **Was:** Removing spaces before tokenization, breaking cloze tasks
- **Fix:** Split text into tokens FIRST, then apply script transform to each token
- **File:** `backend/app/lesson/providers/echo.py`
- **Impact:** All 18 lesson tests now pass (was 16/18)

### 3. **Shop Confetti Celebrations** ‚úÖ DONE
- **Added:** Confetti animation on successful shop purchases
- **File:** `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/shop_page.dart`
- **Impact:** Better user feedback, more engaging UX

### 4. **Interactive Text Reading** ‚úÖ MAJOR FEATURE
- **Added:** Tappable words with morphological analysis
- **Features:**
  - Hover effects with border highlighting
  - Tap any word ‚Üí see lemma, morphology in bottom sheet
  - "Add to SRS" button (FULLY INTEGRATED)
  - Visual highlighting of known words
- **Files:**
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/widgets/interactive_text.dart` (NEW)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/reading_page.dart` (UPDATED)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/services/reader_api.dart` (UPDATED)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/models/reader.dart` (UPDATED)
- **Impact:** Transforms passive reading into active learning - HUGE investor demo value

### 5. **SRS Backend Integration** ‚úÖ DONE (MAJOR COMPLETION)
- **Was:** "Add to SRS" button existed but didn't save to backend
- **Now:** Fully integrated - calls POST /api/v1/srs/cards with auth
- **Features:**
  - Real API integration in ReaderApi.addToSRS()
  - Loading indicator + success/error messages
  - Known words persist to database
  - BuildContext async safety fixes
- **Files:**
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/services/reader_api.dart` (addToSRS method)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/reading_page.dart` (real API calls)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/widgets/interactive_text.dart` (async callback)
- **Backend verified:** POST /api/v1/srs/cards exists, requires auth, saves to DB
- **Impact:** Feature is no longer half-done - production ready

### 6. **Language Texts** ‚úÖ ALREADY EXIST
- **Found:** Both grc-koi and hbo-paleo have seed files
- **Total:** 77 language seed files (daily + canonical)
- **Status:** Nothing to do here
