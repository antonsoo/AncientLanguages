# Critical TODOs - What Actually Needs CODING

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025 (Evening Session)
**Database:** 77/77 language seed files exist ‚úì
**Critical Bugs:** Fixed ‚úì
**Recent Work:** Skill tree real data, Echo provider fix, interactive text reading

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Oct 19, Evening Session)

### 1. **Skill Tree Real Data** ‚úÖ DONE
- **Was:** Showing 10 hardcoded fake lessons
- **Now:** Shows actual completed lessons from LessonHistoryStore
- **File:** `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/skill_tree_page.dart`
- **Impact:** No longer looks fake in demos

### 2. **Echo Provider Scriptio Continua Bug** ‚úÖ DONE
- **Was:** Removing spaces before tokenization, breaking cloze tasks
- **Fix:** Split text into tokens FIRST, then apply script transform to each token
- **File:** `backend/app/lesson/providers/echo.py`
- **Impact:** All 18 lesson tests now pass (was 16/18)

### 3. **Shop Confetti Celebrations** ‚úÖ DONE
- **Added:** Confetti animation on successful shop purchases
- **File:** `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/shop_page.dart`
- **Impact:** Better user feedback, more engaging UX

### 4. **Interactive Text Reading** ‚úÖ MAJOR FEATURE
- **Added:** Tappable words with morphological analysis
- **Features:**
  - Hover effects with border highlighting
  - Tap any word ‚Üí see lemma, morphology in bottom sheet
  - "Add to SRS" button (FULLY INTEGRATED)
  - Visual highlighting of known words
- **Files:**
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/widgets/interactive_text.dart` (NEW)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/reading_page.dart` (UPDATED)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/services/reader_api.dart` (UPDATED)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/models/reader.dart` (UPDATED)
- **Impact:** Transforms passive reading into active learning - HUGE investor demo value

### 5. **SRS Backend Integration** ‚úÖ DONE (MAJOR COMPLETION)
- **Was:** "Add to SRS" button existed but didn't save to backend
- **Now:** Fully integrated - calls POST /api/v1/srs/cards with auth
- **Features:**
  - Real API integration in ReaderApi.addToSRS()
  - Loading indicator + success/error messages
  - Known words persist to database
  - BuildContext async safety fixes
- **Files:**
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/services/reader_api.dart` (addToSRS method)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/reading_page.dart` (real API calls)
  - `client/flutter_reader/lib/widgets/interactive_text.dart` (async callback)
- **Backend verified:** POST /api/v1/srs/cards exists, requires auth, saves to DB
- **Impact:** Feature is no longer half-done - production ready

### 6. **Language Texts** ‚úÖ ALREADY EXIST
- **Found:** Both grc-koi and hbo-paleo have seed files
- **Total:** 77 language seed files (daily + canonical)
- **Status:** Nothing to do here

---

## üö® WHAT STILL NEEDS CODE (Priority Order)

### 1. **Lesson Quality Testing** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status:** All 10 languages tested - 100% success rate!
- **Tested:** grc, lat, san, hbo, akk, sux, egy, non, ang, grc-koi
- **Results:** 10/10 languages successful, 0 issues detected
- **Bugs Fixed:**
  - Test script was checking wrong field names (fixed)
  - Old Norse YAML had unquoted boolean values: `yes`, `no`, `true`, `false` (fixed)
  - Old English YAML had unquoted `on` (YAML treats as boolean) (fixed)
- **Report:** [artifacts/lesson_quality_report.json](../artifacts/lesson_quality_report.json)
- **Impact:** Core product quality verified ‚úì

### 2. **Mobile Build Decision** (2-4 hours OR 5 min decision) üî¥
**Status:** Web builds work, mobile untested
- **Options:**
  1. Test mobile builds thoroughly
  2. Ship web-only for now (update README, deployment docs)
  3. Fix storage package if actually broken
- **Why critical:** Blocks app store release OR need to commit to web-only

### 3. **Word Definition Caching** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**File:** `client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/reading_page.dart`
- **Add:** Cache analyzed words in memory
- **Add:** Show cached definition instantly on second tap
- **Add:** Persist cache to local storage
- **Why important:** Better UX, less API calls

### 4. **Improve Gamification UI** (3-5 hours) üü¢
**Files:** Quests, achievements pages
- **Add:** Achievement unlock celebrations (confetti + modal)
- **Improve:** Quest progress indicators (animated progress bars)
- **Add:** Streak milestone celebrations (7 days, 30 days, etc.)
- **Make:** Daily challenges more prominent on home page
- **Why nice-to-have:** Better engagement

### 5. **Test & Fix TTS** (1-2 hours) üü¢
**Files:** `backend/app/tts/*`
- **Test:** TTS works for grc, lat, san
- **Test:** Audio playback in Flutter app
- **Add:** TTS controls to lesson UI if missing
- **Why nice-to-have:** Audio learning feature

### 6. **Test & Fix Chat** (1-2 hours) üü¢
**File:** `backend/app/chat/*`, `backend/app/api/coach.py`
- **Test:** AI tutor chat works with real conversations
- **Test:** Conversation persistence
- **Improve:** Prompts if responses are poor
- **Why nice-to-have:** Interactive learning

## ‚ùå DO NOT DO

- Write documentation (except code comments)
- Create test frameworks
- Write status reports
- Refactor working code
- Add new features not on this list

---

## üìä REAL NUMBERS

**Estimated coding time to investor-ready:**
- Critical (1): 2-4 hours OR 5 min decision
- Important (2-3): 5-8 hours
- Nice-to-have (4-6): 6-10 hours
- **Total:** 13-22 hours (down from 15-25)

**What's actually blocking investor demos:**
1. Lesson quality testing (4-6 hours) - need to prove it works well
2. Mobile build decision (5 min to decide web-only, or 2-4 hours to test mobile)
3. That's it. Everything else is polish.

---

## üí¨ FOR NEXT AGENT

**Mission:** Write code for items 1-6 above. Nothing else.

**Start with:** Lesson quality testing (item #2) - test 10+ languages, document issues.

**Then decide:** Mobile builds (item #1) - either test thoroughly or commit to web-only.

**Then add:** Word definition caching (item #3) - makes interactive text feature complete.

**Not your mission:**
- Testing frameworks
- Documentation
- Status reports
- "End-to-end testing" (just use the app yourself while coding)

**Measure of success:**
- Lessons tested for 10+ languages, quality documented
- Mobile build decision made and documented
- At least 3-4 items from list completed with actual code changes
- At least 5-10 commits pushed

**Key deliverables:**
1. Lesson quality report for 10+ languages (CRITICAL)
2. Mobile build status documented
3. Word definition caching working
4. Optional: Gamification improvements, TTS/Chat testing
