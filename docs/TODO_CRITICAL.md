# Critical TODO - What Needs Work

**Last Updated**: October 10, 2025

---

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Before Production)

### 1. Device Testing (Flutter App)
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT TESTED
**Impact**: CRITICAL - All Flutter code untested on actual device/emulator

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test on Android device/emulator
- [ ] Test on iOS device/emulator
- [ ] Verify UI looks good (user reported "very poor UI")
- [ ] Test complete user flow: register → login → lesson → challenge → purchase
- [ ] Test offline mode (disable network, complete lesson, reconnect)
- [ ] Verify all animations/interactions work

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS WORK
**Impact**: HIGH - User reported "very poor UI"

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Visual design review and polish
- [ ] Ensure consistent spacing, colors, typography
- [ ] Test on multiple screen sizes
- [ ] Improve onboarding flow
- [ ] Get user feedback on lesson quality

### 3. Content Expansion
**Status**: ✅ PARTIALLY DONE (7,584 Iliad lines seeded)
**Impact**: MEDIUM - More content = better lessons

**Available to seed**:
- [ ] Iliad Books 13-24 (8,103 more lines available)
- [ ] Odyssey (~12,000 lines available from Perseus)
- [ ] Plato's Apology (~1,000 lines available)
- [ ] LSJ Lexicon (top 1000 Greek words with definitions)

**Current content**:
- ✅ 7,584 lines from Iliad (Books 1-12)
- ✅ 212 daily Greek phrases
- ✅ 30 common Greek phrases

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Post-Launch)

### 1. Double-or-Nothing UI
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Full celebration system implemented
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Feature now has full visual feedback

**Completed**:
- ✅ Double-or-nothing modal with wager selection
- ✅ Progress card showing days completed / required
- ✅ Celebration notification on challenge completion
- ✅ Wired to backend endpoint (`/double-or-nothing/complete-day`)
- ✅ Backend coins integration (uses `backendService.userCoins`)

### 2. Latin & Hebrew Support
**Status**: Backend structure ready, needs content
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Expansion to new languages

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Download Latin texts from Perseus (Vergil, Caesar, Cicero)
- [ ] Add Latin seed phrases
- [ ] Test lesson generation for Latin
- [ ] Repeat for Hebrew (Genesis, Psalms)

### 3. OpenAI Timeout Investigation
**Status**: Intermittent timeouts reported
**Impact**: LOW - Has retry logic, but could be improved

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Monitor timeout frequency
- [ ] Increase timeout threshold if needed
- [ ] Consider fallback to smaller model (gpt-5-mini)

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements)

- [ ] Push notifications for challenge expiry
- [ ] Social features (challenge friends, leaderboards)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Additional power-ups (XP boost, hints, skip)
- [ ] A/B testing infrastructure
