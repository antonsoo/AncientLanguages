## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL BUGS (Must fix before launch)

### 1. Language Selection Doesn't Persist
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Test log:** Issue #1
**Bug:** User selects Latin in onboarding, but app defaults to Classical Greek everywhere

**What to fix:**
- [ ] Check language persistence in onboarding_page.dart
- [ ] Fix language_controller.dart to actually save selected language
- [ ] Verify language preference loads correctly on app startup
- [ ] Test: Select Latin â†’ Should stay Latin everywhere (not default to Greek)

**Files to check:**
- client/flutter_reader/lib/pages/onboarding_page.dart
- client/flutter_reader/lib/services/language_controller.dart
- client/flutter_reader/lib/services/language_preferences.dart

### 2. Vocabulary Generation Still Broken
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Test log:** Issue #14
**Bug:** "Failed to generate vocabulary: No output_text found in OpenAI response"

**What happened:** Previous agent claimed to fix this (commit 6981604) but it's STILL BROKEN

**What to fix:**
- [ ] Actually test vocabulary generation with real API call
- [ ] Debug OpenAI response extraction in vocabulary_engine.py
- [ ] Verify fix works for ALL providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- [ ] Add better error logging to see actual API response
- [ ] Test with actual API key, not just code review

**Files to fix:**
- backend/app/lesson/vocabulary_engine.py (line 200+)
- backend/app/lesson/vocabulary_router.py

### 6. New Question Appears After Lesson Completion
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Test log:** Issue #13
**Bug:** Lesson completion popup shows, but new question also renders on screen

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY (Blocking investor demo)

### 7. TTS Pronunciation Doesn't Work Reliably
**Priority:** HIGH
**Test log:** Issues #10, #11

### 8. Language Code "GRC" Too Generic
**Priority:** HIGH (Future-proofing)

## ðŸ“‹ FOR NEXT AI AGENT

### Your Mission: FIX BUGS, DON'T WRITE REPORTS

### Priority Order:
1. Language selection persistence (Issue #1) - CRITICAL
2. Vocabulary generation (Issue #2) - CRITICAL
3. Retry/check button (Issue #3) - CRITICAL
4. BYOK popup (Issue #4) - HIGH
5. Script preference auth (Issue #5) - HIGH
6. TTS/pronunciation (Issue #7) - HIGH
7. UI/UX improvements (Issues #9, #10) - HIGH

### How to Work:
1. RUN THE APP YOURSELF
2. TEST WITH REAL API KEYS
3. FIX, TEST, VERIFY
4. WRITE CODE, NOT REPORTS

### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Backend
docker compose up -d
cd backend && conda activate ancient-languages-py312
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend
cd client/flutter_reader
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=3001
```

### Critical Test Cases:
1. Select Latin â†’ Verify it stays Latin
2. Click "Vocabulary Practice" â†’ Verify it works
3. Get answer wrong â†’ Edit â†’ Check â†’ Verify validation
4. New user â†’ Verify BYOK popup
5. Guest user â†’ Script preference â†’ Verify works
6. Tap to hear â†’ Verify audio plays

---

## ðŸš« WHAT PREVIOUS AGENTS DIDN'T DO

1. Vocabulary was "fixed" but still broken
2. No actual testing done
3. Backend/frontend integration not verified
4. TTS not tested
5. No end-to-end testing

**What WAS done:**
- Code-level bug fixes
- All 46 languages available
- Texts added (untested)
- Fun facts timing

---

## ðŸ’¡ BOTTOM LINE

**App is at 60/100. Get it to 95/100 with REAL fixes.**

**Don't:**
- Give long reports
- Assume fixes work
- Skip testing

**Do:**
- Fix the 13 bugs above
- Test everything
- Write actual code
- Verify end-to-end
