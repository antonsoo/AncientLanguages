# Critical TODOs - What Actually Needs CODING

**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025
**REAL Status:** Backend production-ready, frontend 83% polished (39/47 pages), needs end-to-end testing

---

## üéØ HIGHEST PRIORITY - FRONTEND UI/UX

### 1. **Complete Premium UI Rollout (Almost Done!)**
- **Current:** 39 out of 47 pages have premium UI (83%) ‚ú®
- **Needed:** Upgrade the remaining 8 pages
- **Components:** `PremiumButton`, `PremiumSnackBar`, `ElevatedCard`, `GlowCard`, `HapticService`
- **Impact:** Consistent premium feel across entire app

**8 Pages Still Needing Upgrade:**
```
enhanced_history_page.dart
passage_selection_page.dart
pro_history_page.dart
pro_lessons_page.dart
progress_stats_page.dart
text_structure_page.dart
tutorial_page.dart
vibrant_profile_page.dart
```

**Recently Upgraded (this session):**
- ‚úÖ lessons_page.dart - THE most important page now has premium UI!

### 2. **Test Flutter App End-to-End**
- **Current:** Build succeeds but app hasn't been tested in browser
- **Needed:** Open web app, click through ALL features
- **Critical bugs to find:**
  - Lesson generation flow
  - Text reader word analysis
  - SRS card creation
  - Gamification animations
  - Shop purchases
  - Authentication flow

## üîß HIGH PRIORITY - BACKEND

### 3. **Test All 46 Language Lesson Generation**
- **Current:** Tested with Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Hebrew, Coptic, Old English, Arabic (7 languages)
- **Needed:** Verify lesson generation works for all 46 languages per LANGUAGE_LIST.md
- **Test:** Echo provider first (free), then real APIs if available
- **Files:** `backend/app/lesson/seed/daily_*.yaml` + `backend/app/lesson/language_config.py`

### 4. **Fix Phonetic Transcriptions**
- **File:** `backend/app/lesson/providers/echo.py:1170`
- **Current:** `phonetic_guide=None` (TODO comment exists)
- **Needed:** Add IPA phonetic guides for non-Latin scripts
- **Impact:** Better pronunciation learning

---

## üì± MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 5. **Verify Backend-Frontend Integration**
- **Current:** Backend runs on port 8000/9000, frontend configured correctly
- **Needed:** Test all API endpoints from Flutter app
- **Check:**
  - Lesson generation API
  - Text reader API
  - SRS endpoints
  - Chat endpoints
  - Progress tracking
  - Authentication

### 6. **Improve Error Handling**
- **Current:** Most pages now have PremiumSnackBar with contextual error messages
- **Needed:** Verify error messages are user-friendly throughout
- **Examples:** "No internet connection", "API key invalid", "Text not found"

### 7. **Deploy Web Build**
- **Current:** Build exists at `client/flutter_reader/build/web/`
- **Needed:** Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase
- **Impact:** Shareable demo link for investors/users

---

## üßπ LOW PRIORITY (Polish)

### 8. **Consolidate Duplicate Widgets**
- **Issue:** Multiple similar files might exist
- **Check:** `premium_button.dart` vs `premium_buttons.dart`, etc.
- **Action:** Consolidate or remove duplicates if found

### 9. **Add More Exercise Types**
- **Current:** Alphabet, match, cloze, translate, grammar, listening, speaking, etc.
- **Potential:** More advanced grammar drills, etymology exercises

## ‚ùå NOT COMPLETED (Despite Claims)

- ‚ùå App NOT tested end-to-end in browser
- ‚ùå Not all 46 languages tested (only 7 tested so far)
- ‚ùå Premium UI not on 100% of pages (8 pages remaining)
- ‚ùå Not deployed publicly
- ‚ùå Phonetic guides still missing

**HONEST ASSESSMENT:** Backend is solid and production-ready. Frontend is 83% polished and looks great. App is about 80-85% ready for investors - just needs final 8 pages upgraded and thorough end-to-end testing.

## üí° FOR NEXT AGENT

**FOCUS ON CODE, NOT DOCS.**

**Priority order:**
1. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Upgrade lessons_page.dart (THE most important page!)
2. Upgrade remaining 8 pages with premium UI (should take 1-2 hours)
3. Test app end-to-end in browser, fix any bugs
4. Test lesson generation for all 46 languages
5. Deploy web build to get shareable link

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't write reports about how much you accomplished
- Don't claim "ALL TASKS COMPLETED" unless they actually are
- Don't create new documentation files
- Don't waste time on low-priority polish

**What TO do:**
- Write code that makes the app better
- Test features to find real bugs
- Fix the bugs you find
- Make the UI more beautiful and consistent
- Verify features actually work end-to-end

**Current momentum:** Premium UI rollout is nearly complete (83%)! Just 8 pages left. This is a GREAT time to finish the job and then test everything thoroughly in the browser.
