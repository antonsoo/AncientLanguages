## üü° REMAINING ISSUES (For Next Session)

### 1. Language Selection UI (Onboarding/Settings)

**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL FOR DEMO

**Status:** NEEDS VERIFICATION

**User reported issues:**
- Onboarding page shows only 4 languages (Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit)
- Settings page shows only 4 languages
- Compact language selector (dropdown in tabs) shows only 4 languages
- Order doesn't match LANGUAGE_LIST.md

**Investigation needed:**
- Check if language_picker_sheet.dart is implemented and being used
- Verify onboarding_page.dart language selector
- Verify settings_page.dart language selector
- Verify compact_language_selector.dart
- All should show all 46 languages from LANGUAGE_LIST.md in correct order

### 2. Sound Effects Quality

**PRIORITY:** MEDIUM (Polish)

**Status:** NOT FIXED

**User feedback:**
- Error sound is "dumb" (sounds like old computer)
- Click sounds are not great

**Files:**
- client/flutter_reader/assets/sounds/error.wav
- client/flutter_reader/assets/sounds/success.wav
- client/flutter_reader/assets/sounds/tap.wav
- client/flutter_reader/assets/sounds/whoosh.wav

### 3. Reader Default Text Language

**PRIORITY:** MEDIUM

**Status:** NOT FIXED

**User reported:**

- Should be in the target language being learned

---

### 4. Reader Text Library Content

**PRIORITY:** LOW (Content, not bugs)

**Status:** ONGOING

**User requests:**
- Classical Greek should have 10+ texts available
- Other top languages should have multiple texts
- Better book selection UI

**Notes:**
- This is content work, not a bug
- Texts are stored in database (TextWork model)

### 5. History Page Functionality

**PRIORITY:** LOW

**Status:** NEEDS TESTING

**User reported:**
- History functionality may be broken or only broken for non-signed-in users
