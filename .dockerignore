# IMPORTANT: Keep all other audio/image/font files!
# These may be static assets needed for the app (teaching materials, UI, fonts for ancient scripts)
# Only exclude specific directories with runtime-generated or development files

# Keep backend/migrations - needed for alembic!
# Keep alembic.docker.ini - needed for migrations in container!
# Keep pyproject.toml - needed for package installation!
