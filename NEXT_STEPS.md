# Next Steps - Action Plan

**Updated**: October 9, 2025

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (Do This Today)

### Device Testing - Cannot Launch Without This

```bash
# 1. Start Backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 2. Build & Test Flutter App
cd client/flutter_reader
flutter devices  # Check connected devices
flutter run      # Run on device/emulator

# 3. Test This Exact Flow
```

**Critical User Journey to Test**:
1. ✅ App opens without crashing
2. ✅ Register new account (test@example.com)
3. ✅ Login with credentials
4. ✅ Generate 1 lesson (any difficulty)
5. ✅ Complete the lesson
6. ✅ Verify XP increases on home page
7. ✅ Check daily challenges page
8. ✅ Verify challenge progress updated
9. ✅ Check coins increased
10. ✅ Navigate to power-up shop
11. ✅ Verify coins display correctly
12. ✅ Try purchasing streak freeze
13. ✅ Verify purchase works

**If all 13 steps work**: You're 95% ready to launch. Fix UI polish and ship.

**If any step fails**: Note which step, check error logs, fix the bug, repeat.

## 🔥 CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### 1. ✅ Enabled TTS & Coach Features
**What was wrong**: TTS_ENABLED commented out, COACH_ENABLED missing
**What was fixed**: Both now enabled in `.env`
**Impact**: Users can now use text-to-speech and AI coach

### 2. ✅ Double-or-Nothing Now Works
**What was wrong**: Backend endpoint existed but never called
**What was fixed**: Auto-triggers when all daily challenges complete
**Impact**: Users can now complete double-or-nothing challenges and win 2x coins

### 3. ✅ Fixed Flutter Code Quality
**What was wrong**: 9 analyzer warnings
**What was fixed**: All warnings resolved
**Impact**: Cleaner code, fewer potential runtime bugs

## 🎨 UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS (Optional but Recommended)

### Issues Reported by User
> "Very poor UI"

### Recommended Actions
1. **Test on multiple device sizes** (phone, tablet)
2. **Review color scheme** for consistency
3. **Check spacing** on all major pages
4. **Test dark mode** if enabled
5. **Simplify onboarding** flow
6. **Add loading states** for async operations
7. **Polish animations** (make them snappier)

**Priority**: HIGH (but not blocking)
**Time**: 4-8 hours
**Impact**: Better user retention

---

## 📚 CONTENT EXPANSION (Optional)

### Currently Available
- ✅ 7,584 Iliad lines (Books 1-12)
- ✅ 212 daily Greek phrases
- ✅ 30 conversation phrases

### Ready to Seed (If You Want More Variety)
```bash
# Seed additional content (backend/scripts/)
cd backend

# Option 1: Add more Iliad
python scripts/seed_perseus_content.py --books 13-24

# Option 2: Add Odyssey
# (would need to download XML from Perseus first)

# Option 3: Add Plato
# (would need to download XML from Perseus first)
```

**Priority**: LOW (can launch without)
**Time**: 2-4 hours
**Impact**: More lesson variety

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Device Build Fails

**Android**:
```bash
cd client/flutter_reader
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

**iOS** (requires macOS):
```bash
cd client/flutter_reader
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
flutter build ios
```

### If App Crashes on Startup

Check these common issues:
1. Backend not running on expected port
2. API base URL wrong in Flutter config
3. Missing dependencies in pubspec.yaml
4. Permissions not granted (network, storage)

**Debug**:
```bash
# View Flutter logs
flutter logs

# View Android logs
adb logcat | grep flutter

# View iOS logs (Xcode Console)
```

### If Lessons Don't Generate

Check these:
1. API keys set in backend `.env`
2. `LESSONS_ENABLED=1` in backend `.env`
3. Backend actually running
4. No API rate limits hit
5. Check backend logs for errors

### If Challenges Don't Update

Check these:
1. User is logged in (check auth token)
2. Backend running and accessible
3. Check network connectivity
4. Check browser console for 401/403 errors
5. Verify coins sync (if coins update, challenges should too)

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### For Device Testing
- Start with Android (easier to test)
- Use Android Studio emulator if no device
- Test on cheapest device possible (most users won't have flagships)
- Test with slow network (throttle to 3G)

### For Launch
- Soft launch to friends first
- Monitor backend logs actively
- Have rollback plan ready
- Start with small user base (10-50)
- Scale up slowly

### For Success
- Talk to users early and often
- Fix bugs fast (within 24 hours)
- Ship updates weekly
- Focus on lesson quality over quantity
- Gamification drives retention - make it work well

## 🆘 GETTING HELP

### If You Get Stuck
1. Check error logs first (backend console, flutter logs)
2. Search for exact error message online
3. Check Flutter/FastAPI docs
4. Ask in Discord/Reddit communities

### If Integration Broken
1. Read `INTEGRATION_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md` for details
2. All endpoints verified - issue is likely config
3. Check `.env` variables
4. Verify database running
5. Check auth tokens

### If Performance Issues
1. Backend should handle 100+ concurrent users fine
2. Flutter should be smooth on mid-range phones
3. If slow: Check database indexes, API response times
4. Use Flutter DevTools for UI performance

## ✅ TODAY'S ACTION ITEMS

1. **Read this document** ✓ (you just did)
2. **Start backend**: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
3. **Run on device**: `flutter run`
4. **Test 13-step flow** (see top of doc)
5. **Report results**: Note what works, what breaks
6. **Fix critical bugs**: Focus on showstoppers first
