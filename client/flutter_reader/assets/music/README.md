# Background Music Directory Structure

This directory contains background music organized by language code.

## ðŸŽµ How It Works

The music system **automatically discovers and plays all music files** in each language folder. Just drop music files into the appropriate language directory and they'll be added to the playlist!

## Directory Structure

```
music/
â”œâ”€â”€ lat/              # Classical Latin
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Gloriosum_Triumphale.mp3
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Confessio_Noctis.mp3
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [any other .mp3/.flac/.ogg files]
â”œâ”€â”€ grc-cls/          # Classical Greek
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sunrise_Over_Aegean.mp3
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Lament_for_a_Broken_God.mp3
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [any other music files]
â”œâ”€â”€ grc-koi/          # Koine Greek
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [your music files here]
â”œâ”€â”€ hbo/              # Biblical Hebrew
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [your music files here]
â””â”€â”€ [other language codes]/
    â””â”€â”€ [your music files here]
```

## Adding Music Files (Super Easy!)

1. **Create a directory** for the language using its language code (e.g., `lat`, `grc-cls`, `hbo`, `san`)
2. **Drop in ANY music files** with these extensions:
   - `.mp3` (recommended - best compatibility)
   - `.flac` (high quality)
   - `.ogg` (open format)
   - `.wav` (uncompressed)
   - `.m4a` (AAC format)
3. **Name them whatever you want!**
   - âœ… `Epic_Battle_Theme.mp3`
   - âœ… `peaceful-monastery-01.mp3`
   - âœ… `track_003.mp3`
   - âœ… `My Cool Song (2025 Remaster).flac`
4. The app will **automatically detect and play them all** as a shuffled playlist!

**No configuration needed!** The `MusicService` scans the asset manifest and plays everything it finds.

## Music Style Guidelines

Music should be:
- Instrumental only (no vocals)

- Culturally authentic when possible
- Royalty-free or properly licensed
